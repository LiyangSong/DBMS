## Q1

Create a normalized (BCNF) relational schema and visualize the schema in an ERD (in Crow's Feet/IE Notation) for the data in the XML file.

[ERD in LucidChart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/635860c7-d9cc-4f90-80a2-ea35ce406ec8/edit?viewport_loc=31%2C-10%2C1277%2C564%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_96bb09dc-4137-4d5a-a478-b10f8ba9c6ed)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/GYwugGP.png")
```

## Q2

Create a SQLite database that implements the schema

```{r}
rm(list = ls())

require(XML)
require(RSQLite)

dbfile <- "books.db"
fpath <- getwd()
conn <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), paste0(fpath, '/', dbfile))
```

```{r}
dbExecute(conn, "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Book")
dbExecute(conn, "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Author")
dbExecute(conn, "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Genre")
```

```{r}
sql <- "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Author (
            aid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            author TEXT)"
dbExecute(conn, sql)

sql <- "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Genre (
            gid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            genre TEXT)"
dbExecute(conn, sql)

sql <- "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Book (
            bid INTEGER,
            aid INTEGER,
            title TEXT,
            edition TEXT,
            gid INTEGER,
            price NUMERIC,
            publish_date DATE,
            description TEXT,
            PRIMARY KEY (bid),
            FOREIGN KEY (aid) REFERENCES Author(aid),
            FOREIGN KEY (gid) REFERENCES Genre(gid))"
dbExecute(conn, sql)
```

## Q3

Load the XML data from the file into R data frames; you will need to use either node-by-node traversal of the XML tree or a combination of node-by-node traversal with XPath; you likely will not be able to accomplish it with only XPath. Use surrogate keys and/or the ID attributes in the XML to establish relationships.

```{r}
xmlDOM <- xmlParse("Books-v3.xml")
root <- xmlRoot(xmlDOM)
num_books <- xmlSize(root)

df.book <- data.frame(bid = vector (mode = "integer",
                                    length = num_books),
                      aid = vector (mode = "integer",
                                    length = num_books),
                      title = vector (mode = "character",
                                      length = num_books),
                      edition = vector (mode = "character",
                                        length = num_books),
                      gid = vector (mode = "integer",
                                    length = num_books),
                      price = vector (mode = "numeric",
                                      length = num_books),
                      publish_date = vector (mode = "character",
                                             length = num_books),
                      description = vector (mode = "character",
                                            length = num_books),
                      stringsAsFactors = F)

df.author <- data.frame(aid = integer(),
                        author = character(),
                        stringsAsFactors = F)

df.genre <- data.frame(gid = integer(),
                       genre = character(),
                       stringsAsFactors = F)
```

```{r}
authorList = list()
genreList = list()

for (i in 1:num_books) {
    abook <- root[[i]]
    df.book$bid[i] <- as.integer(substring(xmlGetAttr(abook, "id"), 3, 5))
    df.book$title[i] <- xpathSApply(abook, "./title", xmlValue)
    df.book$price[i] <- as.numeric(xpathSApply(abook, "./price", xmlValue))
    df.book$publish_date[i] <- xpathSApply(abook, "./publish_date", xmlValue)
    df.book$description[i] <- xpathSApply(abook, "./description", xmlValue)
    
    edition <- xpathSApply(abook, "./edition", xmlValue)
    if (length(edition) == 0) {
        edition <- ""
    }
    df.book$edition[i] <- edition
    
    author <- xpathSApply(abook, "./author", xmlValue)
    if (!(author %in% authorList)) {
        authorList <- append(authorList, author)
        num_authors <- length(authorList)
        df.author <- rbind(df.author, data.frame(aid = num_authors, 
                                                 author = author, 
                                                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
    }
    
    genre <- xpathSApply(abook, "./genre", xmlValue)
    if (!(genre %in% genreList)) {
        genreList <- append(genreList, genre)
        num_genres <- length(genreList)
        df.genre <- rbind(df.genre, data.frame(gid = num_genres, 
                                               genre = genre, 
                                               stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
    }
}
```

```{r}
for (i in 1:num_books) {
    abook <- root[[i]]
    author <- xpathSApply(abook, "./author", xmlValue)
    genre <- xpathSApply(abook, "./genre", xmlValue)
    df.book$aid[i] <- df.author$aid[which(df.author$author == author)]
    df.book$gid[i] <- df.genre$gid[which(df.genre$genre == genre)]
}

```

```{r}
df.book
```

```{r}
df.author
```

```{r}
df.genre
```

## Q4

Transform data types as necessary and then save the data frames to the appropriate tables in the database using a strategy of your choice (e.g., dbWriteTable()).

```{r}
dbWriteTable(conn, "Book", df.book, overwrite = F, append = T, row.names = F)
dbWriteTable(conn, "Author", df.author, overwrite = F, append = T, row.names = F)
dbWriteTable(conn, "Genre", df.genre, overwrite = F, append = T, row.names = F)
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM Book")
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM Author")
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM Genre")
```

## Q5

Once the data from the XML is in the database, build SQL chunks for the following queries against the SQLite database:

### A. What is the number of genres have at least three books?

```{sql, connection=conn}
SELECT COUNT(*) AS GenreNumWithThreeBooks
FROM (
    SELECT g.gid, COUNT(b.bid) AS BookNum
    FROM Genre g
    JOIN Book b ON g.gid=b.gid
    GROUP BY g.gid
    HAVING BookNum >= 3
) AS GenreWithThreeBooks
```

### B. What is the oldest year in which a publication was published?

```{sql, connection=conn}
SELECT MIN(strftime('%Y', publish_date)) AS OldestYear
FROM Book
```

### C. Find the number of books and average price for each genre.

```{sql, connection=conn}
SELECT g.genre, COUNT(b.bid) AS BookNum, AVG(b.price) AS AvgPrice
FROM Genre g
JOIN Book b ON g.gid=b.gid
GROUP BY g.genre
```

### D. List the title and author of all books that are less than 0.8*AVG or more than 1.2*AVG, where AVG is the average price of all books.

```{sql, connection=conn}
SELECT b.title, a.author
FROM Book b
JOIN Author a ON b.aid=a.aid
WHERE b.price < 0.8 * (SELECT AVG(price) FROM Book)
OR b.price > 1.2 * (SELECT AVG(price) FROM Book)
```
