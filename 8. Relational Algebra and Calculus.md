        )
    )

### Q4 Find the number of students in each course during the "Spring 2023" term.
$<{cid}>\mathfrak{F}_{<{cid, cname, COUNT(tid)}>}(
    \sigma_{term='Spring\ 2023'}(
        Students \bowtie Enrollment \bowtie Sections \bowtie Courses
    )
)$

### Q5 How many courses are offered during the "Spring 2023" term that have more than one section?

$COUNT(
    \pi_{cid}(
        \sigma_{sectionNum>1}(
            \rho_{CourseSection(cid, sectionNum)}(
                <{cid}>\mathfrak{F}_{<{cid, COUNT(sid)}>}(
                    \sigma_{term='Spring\ 2023'}(
                        Courses \bowtie Sections
                    )  
                ) 
            )
        )
    )      
)$

### Q6 List the names and majors of all students in the college "Khoury" who have a GPA below 3.0 and are not on coop.

$\pi_{sname, major}(
    \sigma_{(college='Khoury')\wedge(gpa<3.0)\wedge(onCoop=F)}(
        Students
    )
)$


### Q7 Find the distinct names of all courses that have at least 2 but no more than 5 credit hours.

$\{c.cname:Courses(c)\wedge (c.hours\geq 2) \wedge (c.hours\leq 5)\}$

### Q8 Write the equivalent tuple relational calculus expression for the SQL statement below:
```
SELECT sname, gpa 
  FROM Students
 WHERE plusOne = T AND gpa < 2.5;
```

$\{s.sname, s.gpa:Students(s)\wedge (s.plusOne = T)\wedge (s.gpa < 2.5)\}$

### Q9 Write the equivalent relational algebra expression for the SQL statement below:
```
SELECT sname, gpa 
  FROM Students
 WHERE plusOne = T 
   AND (gpa BETWEEN 2.99 AND 4.0);
```

$\pi_{sname, gpa}(
    \sigma_{(plusOne=T)\wedge (gpa\geq2.99)\wedge (gpa\leq 4.0)}(
        Studetns
    )
)$

### Q10 Write a single equivalent SQL statement for the relational algebra expression below:

$\rho_{KhourySections}(\sigma_{college='Khoury'}(Courses\bowtie Sections))$

$\pi_{term,cname,room}(\sigma_{block='G'\vee block='H'}(KhourySections))$

```
SELECT term, cname, room
FROM Courses
JOIN Sections ON Courses.cid=Sections.cid
WHERE college = 'Khoury'
AND (block = 'G' OR block = 'H');
```
